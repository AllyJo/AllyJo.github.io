    <h2>Existing Website Information</h2>
    <p>I chose the <a href="https://www.padi.com/">Padi Website</a>
    The website has a lot more happening than mine, which is to be expected. There are 'button' features that allow the user to navigate to other linked pages. The page also has click-able images, which will navigate to another page. Once I gain more experience with the different tags, (such as 'div', 'section' and 'class') and incorporating different languages (such as JSON and Javascript).  </p>
